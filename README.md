# 📊 alumathPeerGroup17: PCA Project

This project explores **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** as part of the *Alumath Peer Group* coursework. It includes a dataset, screenshots of our results, and the Google Colab notebook we used for implementing PCA from scratch.

alumathPeerGroup17/
├── content/ # Contains the raw dataset used for PCA
├── eigen-values and vectors/ # Screenshots and PCA computation results
└── PCA_colab_notebook.ipynb # Main Google Colab file used for PCA

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the core steps of PCA (centering, covariance, eigendecomposition)
- Apply PCA to a real dataset
- Visualize the results using screenshots and notebook outputs

---

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- NumPy & pandas
- matplotlib (for plotting)
- SymPy (for symbolic math, if used)
- Dataset (stored in `/content/`)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the file `PCA_colab_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Normalize and center the data
   - Compute the covariance matrix
   - Extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors
   - Select top principal components based on explained variance
   - Project the data onto lower dimensions
